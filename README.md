1. Implement Bresemham's line drawing algorithm for all types of slope.

2. Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.

3. Program to draw a color cube and spin it using openGL transformation matrices.

4. Program to draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment with perspective viewing using OpenGL functions.

5. Clip the lines using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm.

6. To draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define Suitably the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the surfaces of the solid object used in the scene.

7. Design, develop and implement recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.

8. Develop a menu driven program to animate a flag using Bezier curve algorithm.

9. Develop a menu driven program to fill any given polygon using scanline area filling algorithm.
